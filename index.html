                        LED Lights. Quadcopters generally use two pairs of identical fixed pitched propellers; two
                        clockwise (CW) and two counterclockwise (CCW). These use independent variation of the speed of
                        each rotor to achieve control. By changing the speed of each rotor it is possible to
                        specifically generate a desired total thrust; to locate for the centre of thrust both laterally
                        and longitudinally; and to create a desired total torque, or turning force.</p>
